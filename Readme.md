# Cargo archive

ðŸš§ This tool is a WIP ðŸš§

The goal is to provide a tool for compressing heavy target directories in rust project. 

This is composed of two executables: 
- `cargo-archive`: compress the current workspace's target directory in a `target.tar.zstd` file
- `cargo-unarchive`: uncompress a `target.tar.zstd` file in the current workspace's target directory

No options or configuration are available at the moment.
